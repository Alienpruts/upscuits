Upscuits 
===============
_Short for crispy uptime-biscuits_

With Upscuits you have a nice overview of the uptime of your servers, and a page to share with your customers.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/digibart/upscuits.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/digibart/upscuits)

Tools needed:
---------------
* A webserver capable of serving static files
* A free account at [Uptime Robot](http://uptimerobot.com)
* A oven or text-editor


Preparations:
---------------
_You can skip step 1 and 2 if you've already got a monitor at Uptime Robot_

1. Login at Uptime Robot.
2. Add a new monitor
3. Go to [MySettings](http://uptimerobot.com/dashboard.php#mySettings) ("Monitor-Specific API Keys" at bottom right) and create/write down the API key for the monitor.


Directions:
---------------
1. Clone or copy all files in `public` to your webserver/ shared hosting
2. Copy `public/js/config.example.js` to `public/js/config.js`
3. Paste one ore more API keys as an array in `config.js`


Your own flavor:
---------------
This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). You could edit the files in the `public` folder, but is advised to use Grunt to build the files in `public`-folder. Install Grunt with:

`$ npm install -g grunt-cli`

Next, install the required grunt plugins from `packages.json` by running:

`$ npm install`

Now modify the code in the folder `source` as it pleases you. While editing you can use this to build everytime you save a file: 

`$ grunt watch`

To serve the `public`-folder on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) run:

`$ grunt connect watch`

To only compile the less files, use `grunt css`, or to concat javascript files use `grunt js`. To make a new release, run:

`grunt`


### Testing

For testing we use Mocha - the fun, simple, flexible JavaScript test framework. Specs are written in `test/spec/test.js`

Before runing tests, run [bower - A package manager for the web](http://bower.io) to install Mocha and his friends:

	$ cd test
	$ bower install

Now you can run the tests with:

`$ grunt test`

To run the tests in a browser:

`$ grunt connect:test:keepalive`
